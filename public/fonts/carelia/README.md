# Carelia Font Files

This directory should contain the following Carelia font files:

- `Carelia.woff2`
- `Carelia.woff`

## How to add the font files

1. Purchase or download the Carelia font from a legitimate source
2. Copy the `.woff2` and `.woff` files to this directory
3. Ensure the filenames match exactly as shown above

## Important Note

The Carelia font is a commercial font. Make sure you have the proper license to use it in your project.

If the font files are not added to this directory, the website will fall back to the system serif font.
